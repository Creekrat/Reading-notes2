# Layout
Key concepts in positioning elements:
 - building blocks: css treats each htmle element as its own box. Either for block-level or inline boxes.
 - containing elements:if one block-level elements is inside another block-level element.

CSS has many positioning schemes like:
 - normal-flow: position is static
 - relative potitioning: position is relative
 - absolute positioning: position is absolute
 - fixed positioning: position is fixed
 - floating elements: position is float


< div > are often used as a containing element to group sections of a page together.
Browsers will display in normal flow unless you use relative, absolute, or fixed positioning

The float property moves stuff to the left or the rigth of a page and can create multi-column layouts. These floated items require defined width. Pages can be fixed with width or stretchy layouts.

A designer will normally keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide and indicate what is on the site or what it is about within 600 pixels.

Grids will help create professional and flexible designs

it's best to use frameworks they provide rules for common tasks

you can include these CSS files in one page.
