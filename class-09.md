# Forms

There are several types of form controls you can use to get information from visitors from your page:
 - Adding text
 - Making choices
 - Submitting forms

Forms work by a user adding in information in the form and pressing a button to submit it. Forms can have several form controls and each one gathers different information.

Form structure uses the < form > elements and to input info you would use the < input > element. information from a form is sent in a name/value pairs. Every form is given a name, and the information a user types in or the values they select is sent to the server. To make it easier for visitors to fill in forms HTML5 was brought into the mix.

# Lists,Tables, and Forms

Just like the CSS properties work with the contents of all elements, there are others that work with the appearance of lists, tables, and forms. List markers can be given defferent looks using the list-style-type and list-style image properties. Also, table cells can be given different types of borders and spacing in browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. When the form controls are vertically aligned they are easier to use, forms benefit from styles that make them more interactive.

# Events

Events: a browser's way indicating when something has to happen.

Binding: is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that specific event to happen upon.

When an event happens on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. This function then changes the webpage in some way, and makes it feel interactive because is has responded to the user. 

The most commonly used events:
 - W3C DOM events
 (even though there are others in HTML5 specifications as well as browser events.)
