## CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

What Google learned:

Google learned that bringing people into teams (without micromanaging and also, the need for good communication) this would be more productive to the company. They even had, Rozovsky, hired and assigned to Project Aristotle. Project Aristotle began research by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. They looked into people's hobbies, educational backgrounds and more to gain knowledge  about how well people worked together in a team and who were the right fits for each set team. It was impossible to find patterns however no matter how many times researchers arranged the data they discovered.

*We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The "who" part of the equation didn't seem to matter. -- Abeer Dubey*

### Transforms

2D Transforms
Elements can be distorted or trasformed on both a two dimensional plane or a three dimension plane. The 2d transforms work on the X and Y axes and is known as the horizontal and vertical axes. You can do many things with the 2d transform:
 - 2D rotate
 - 2D scale
 - 2D translate
 - 2D skew
 - 2D cube
 - and you can combine these

2D Transforms

The three dimensional plane transforms work on the X and Y axes as well as the Z axis. You can also do alot of different things:
 - 3D rotate
 - 3D scale
 - 3D translate
 - 3D skew
 - Shorthand 3D transforms

Also there are transform origin and perspective:( in order for three dimensional transforms to work)
 - Perspective value
 - Perspective property
 - Perspective Depth value
 - Perspective origin
The Transforms:
 - transform style
 - backface visibility

Transforms are easy ways to alter and position elements by using general layout techniques like, size, position, and change elements. 

### Transitions and Animations

For a transition to work an element must have a change in state and different styles must be identified for each state.To determine styles for different states you could use :hove, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes in CSS. You can use whats called the Transitioin-Property to determine exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties.There are different transitional properties:
 - background-color
 - border-width
 - clip
 - font-size
 - left
 - margin
 - min-height
 - outline-color
 - padding
 - text-shadow
 - visibility
 - z-index
 - background-position
 - border-spacing
 - color
 - font-weight
 - letter-spacing
 - max-height
 - min-width
 - outline-offset
 - right
 - top
 - width
 - border-color
 - bottom
 - crop
 - height
 - line-height
 - max-width
 - opacity
 - outline-width
 - text-indent
 - vertical-align
 - word-spacing

the duration that a transition takes place is called transition duration and it is set using general timing values including seconds and milliseconds. You can also have transition delay and transition timing and you can also have shorthand transitions.

Animations are built using transitions to build visual interactions.You can have:
 - animation keyframes
 - animation names
 - animation duration, timing function, and delay
 - animation iteration
 - animation direction
 - animation play-state
 - animation fill mode
 - you can even use shorthand animations

8 ways to wow users with transitions:
 - fade in
 - change color
 - grow and shrink
 - rotate elements
 - square to circle
 - 3D shadow
 - swing
 - inset border

These will give you some cool transition effects that will shock your users, increase engagement and ultimately, if used well, increase conversions.
