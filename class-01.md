**HTML and CSS**

How do people access the web?

Well people can access it in many ways. People use things like:
 - Browsers- A software used to access websites.
 - Web Servers- These host the websites
 - Devices- You can access websites through many devices like; Computers,Phones,and Tablets.
 - Screen Readers- These are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. Commonly used by the visual impaired.

Any website is created by using the basics:
 - HTML- The *bones* of a webpage
 - CSS- The *decor* of a webpage
 - JavaScript- The *interactive* parts of a webpage

When you open a webpage the majority of what you see is HTML and CSS. These are the coding languages used to create the visual aspect of a webpage.
HTML and CSS have improved over the years and have updated to HTML5 and CSS3. These versions build off of older languages so learning these previous versions help in developing new ones.

 - When using the web, the web server hosting any site can be anywhere in the world. To find the location of the web server, the web browser will first connect to a Domain Name System server. When you connect to the web you do so by connecting to whats called a Internet Service Provider. You type in the domain name or web address to visit a site.
 - Your computer contacts a network of servers (DNS) and they act like a phone book to tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. *every device on the web has a unique IP address* (like a telephone number for your computer)
 - The unique number that your DNS server returns to your computer allows the browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
